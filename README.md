# Automation-of-animal-detection-in-thermal-camera-image
Wild animals are active at night, needing special equipment for study. Monitoring creates extensive data requiring specific analysis. Methods like Falzenszwalb segmentation and YOLOv3 neural network transfer learning are compared. The study enhances results using advanced YOLO versions, optimizing via genetic algorithms.

# Structure of repository

Repository consist all files which where usde during training and tests besides training data (they are shown as examples but not whole dataset)

## YOLOv5 
In this folder are gathered in three notebooks:
- OldDataset2YoloFormat.ipynb -responsible for changing format from xml from labelme
- YOLOv5_baseline_dataset.ipynb -responsible for traning, testing and visualising predictions (Attention! The data were hidden for puprpose. To use command !gdown pls contact with author via mail for key)
- Plot_Yolov5_results.ipynb - for plotting results gained during training

## Classical segmentation
In this folder are gathered scripts:

## Dataset
