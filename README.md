# Automation-of-animal-detection-in-thermal-camera-image
Wild animals are active at night, needing special equipment for study. Monitoring creates extensive data requiring specific analysis. The repository contains the extensive study of topic analyzing thermal images with advanced segmentation technic. Methods like Falzenszwalb segmentation and YOLOv3 neural network transfer learning are compared. The study enhances results using advanced YOLO versions, optimizing via genetic algorithms. All uploaded materials were utilised for master thesis on Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty - Eletronics an Information Technology. The title of the thesis is: "Automatization of animal detection in thermal camera images"


# Structure of repository

The repositiry was devided into temetic catalogues, which consist important files for utilised technics. 

## YOLOv5 
In this folder are gathered in three notebooks:
- OldDataset2YoloFormat.ipynb -responsible for changing format from xml from Labelme
- YOLOv5_baseline_dataset.ipynb -responsible for traning, testing and visualising predictions (Attention! The data were hidden for puprpose. To use command !gdown pls contact with author via mail for key)
- Plot_Yolov5_results.ipynb - for plotting results gained during training

## Classical segmentation
In this folder are gathered scripts:

## Dataset
